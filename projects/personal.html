            In addition to the projects I worked on in my courses and through my co-ops, I took on multiple personal projects. Through these I had the chance to experiment with 
            the different engineering skills I had learned and my 3D printer, as well to solve simple problems I faced in my day to day life.

                <p> 
                    A stylophone is an analog electrical instrument played with a stylus. Due to my passion for music, and the simplicity of the instrument I undertook a project to 
                    make one. It is based off a 555 timer, which when different resistance values are used, caused by touching a different a different key, a different note is produced.
                    In addition to the different notes, I implemented a volume control, a tuning potentiometer, a vibrato switch, and a power switch. I 3D printed a case to snugly 
                    hold all the different components of the device.

                <h3 class="proj-header">Automatic Guitar Tuner</h3>
                <p>
                    Continuing the theme of musical projects, I also worked to make an automatic guitar tuner. The theory of operation was to take the output signal from an electric 
                    guitar, amplify it and feed it to a PIC microcontroller. The microcontroller would then process the signal, determine the frequency of the signal, and which string 
                    the output was coming from. It would then drive a servo to either tighten or loosen the string, to match the proper note. The board was designed using KiCAD, and 
                    the code for the PIC was written in C in MPLAB.

                <p> 
                    Due to the age of my car, it does not have Bluetooth, or any music control. This means that when my phone is plugged into the aux, I have no control over what 
                    is playing and am unable to pause it. To solve this problem, I created a board I could mount above my radio which had pause, play and fast-forward buttons. It 
                    operates the same way as headphones that have the same control, as outlined in the <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/interaction/accessories/headset/plug-headset-spec">android headphone specification.</a>
                    I 3D printed the mount which slots into the unused CD drive.

                In addition to my other projects, I have done a decent amount of 3D printing. These are small projects to solve simple annoyances, and experiment with my printer,
                SolidWorks, and OnShape.
