            The Waterloo Rocketry team designs, manufactures and tests a hybrid rocket each year for launch at the Spaceport America Cup and Launch Canada competitions.
            Through my 5 years on the team, I had a chance to work on three seperate rockets, Shark of the Sky, Kraken of the Sky and Leviathan of the sky. These rockets placed
            in the top 3 in the hybrid 30,000 ft category each year at Spaceport America.

                <p>
                    FAST stands for Fast Actuation Solenoid Nitrous Transfer. The goal of this project was to reduce the weight of the injector valve of the rocket,
                    as well as to decrease the time it takes to reach the maximum flow rate of nitrous oxide. The previous injector valve used a heavy motor to open a mechanical valve.
                    FAST uses a solenoid valve to allow a pneumatic cylinder to turn a ball valve. This project required calculation of the air pressure required,
                    the volume of air needed, as well as the length of the arm to provide enough torque to open the valve. This upgrade saved approximately 3.5 lbs,
                    on a rocket weighing 85 lbs dry, which is a 4% weight savings.

                <p>
                    Due to airspace regulations in Canada, the team was unable to test launch our rocket before either competition. In testing the various systems of the rocket,
                    we aimed to test and validate our reefing parachute design. In order to accomplish this we partnered with a local helicopter company to conduct a drop test of the
                    recovery system. For this test I  made multiple modifications to the electrical system; the remote arming circuit board and code needed to be modified so the system was only armed directly before deployment and so the board could communicate its state
                    to ensure the operators of the test were safe at all times. These changes were tested using a vacuum chamber to simulate changes in altitude.

                <p>
                    I led the design of the actuator circuit board. Originally meant for use with the injector valve,
                    this board is used in multiple parts of the rocket including the injector valve, vent valve, and fill disconnect.
                    Using a PIC microcontroller as the brains, the board is connected to RocketCAN, the CAN Bus which interconnects the entire rocket,
                    and tells the associated valve, or actuator, when to actuate by powering a transistor.
                    Additionally, the board accommodates voltage sensing in order to track the associated batteries for the valves,
                    and two limit switches that track the valve position. This board was designed using KiCAD, printed by a third party, and populated by the team.

                <p>
                    In order to test the rocket engine static fires are conducted to validate and get a thrust profile of the engine.
                    To run these tests, the proper infrastructure is required. I designed a tank stand to hold the oxidizer tank vertically during these tests.
                    The stand had to be tall enough to accommodate the 6-foot tank and all required plumbing, be strong enough to support the 100lb tank,
                    and stable enough to withstand winds up to 50km/h winds as testing occurred outdoors. The stand was designed in SolidWorks,
                    including FEA (finite element analysis) being done to ensure that the required factors of safety were met.
