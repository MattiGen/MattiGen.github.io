                <p>At the culmination of my degree, we were tasked with a fourth-year design, or capstone, project. The intention of the project is to identify a problem 
                    and create a mechatronic system to solve it. The problem my group chose to solve is that the tools used to measure the profile of a hockey skate are analog, and the results are prone to human interpretation. 
                    We aimed to create an automated digital solution that could measure and characterize a skate blade within a hundreth of a millimeter. My role on this project was to design the electrical
                    system, as well as to write the code for communication between the measurement device and the user's computer.</p>

                <p>
                    The theory of operation of the device is to use a Keyence IL-300, a laser distance sensor, to scan the bottom of a skate blade and determine its profile. 
                    The skate is mounted above the sensor with a magnetic clamp. The sensor then moves along linear bearings to scan the length of the blade. 
                    These distance measurements are collected and sent to the user's device over Bluetooth to be handled by software on the client's device. The software is
                    written in JavaScript, filters the received data, and calculates the profile of the blade. The profile is then presented on a web page for the client to
                    see the profile and identify any abnormalities in the blade.

                <p>
                    The electrical system is based on an ESP32, which comes. packaged on a Feather breakout board. A custom PCB was designed for the feather to sit on, which 
                    contains circuitry for an h-bridge motor controller, limit switches, as well as an analog input for our sensor. The microcontroller controller and digital logic
                    operate on a 3.3V line, which is regulated from a 5V USB connection. The stepper motor which drives the belt to move the sensor has its own 7.5V power supply. 
                    The schematic and PCB layout were designed in KiCAD.

                <p>
                    To communicate between the board and the user's computer the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) protocol was used. The ESP32 acts as a Bluetooth server;  
                    written in C++ using the Arduino built-in BLE library. The user's computer acted as the Bluetooth server with the code being written in 
                    JavaScript to allow our web app to receive the data. The server keeps a queue of all data points and sends the server the next one when an acknowledgement
                    is received. This allows us to ensure that no data points are dropped, even if there is a brief disconnect.
