                <p>
                    Columbiad Launch Services is a small aerospace company based in Kitchener Ontario which focuses on researching and developing a nano-thermite rocket fuel system 
                    for in-space propulsion. My role as aa aerospace engineering coop was researching and designing the combustion chamber and ignition for a CubeSat-sized engine.

                <p>
                    Siemens Healthineers developed a portable blood diagnostic device, called the EPOC system. My role at Siemens was to run quality assurance tests to ensure that the firmware on this 
                    device was operating as intended. When it comes to testing a medical device it is incredibly important to ensure that the results shown are correct and that
                    the privacy of the patient is properly protected.
                    <br>
                    In addition to running manual tests on the EPOC, I automated unit test runs using PyTest in Python and authored Software Testing, Verification & Reliability (STVR) documents for newly developed and
                    updated in-house software.

                <p>
                    Espial Group provides a cloud-based Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) service. Some of Espial's clients include Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, and Roku. 
                    My role as a server-side cloud developer was to develop and test client-facing APIs using Python. These APIs include new functions which 
                    clients requested, optimizing existing functions, and fixing different reported bugs. At Espial we operated under an agile workflow which included biweekly sprint 
                    meetings to plan the next two weeks at work, as well as daily standups to ensure the sprint was on track or to pull in new user stories when we were ahead.

                <p>
                    Indal is a subsidiary of Curtiss Wright which develops solutions for securing helicopters on board ship decks. My role was to run dynamic analysis simulations on
                    helicopter stability on deck during different wind and water conditions. These simulations were run on a proprietary in-house software, and automated different 
                    simulation cases using Batch scripts. Due to the nature of the work, I had to obtain NATO Security Clearance and Controlled Goods Clearance.

                <p>
                    Leap Tools Inc. developed Roomvo, which is an in-browser software for visualizing different flooring and furnishing in your room. It uses augmented reality to
                    determine the features of the room and overlay different options. As a full stack developer, I worked on the user interface of the web-app, and developed the 
                    backend APIs. The frontend was coded in JavaScript using Polymer as the main library and the backend was coded in Python using Django Rest Framework. Since 
                    the company was a small startup while I was there, I also had the opportunity to do some product and UI design and implement features I came up with and designed.
                    Feel free to play around with the app I helped develop <a href="https://www.roomvo.com/my/fdemo"> here.</a>
