                <p>
                    In Fire Safety Engineering we discussed the physics behind ignition and fire behaviour in residential scenarios. As a final project in this course,
                    I wrote a literature review on lithium-ion batteries, their use in electric vehicles, and how to improve safety features in these batteries.
                    The following is an excerpt from the paper's abstract, and the entire paper can be found <a href="documents/LithiumIonBatteryReview.pdf">here.</a>
                    <br>
                    "As the use of electric and hybrid vehicles increases, so do incidents resulting in them catching fire. This report aims to review how the (lithium-ion) battery
                    packs are protected in a vehicle crash, and current research into the prevention and suppression of lithium-ion batterie fires."

                <p>
                    Fluid Power Control systems covers the properties of hydraulic fluids, the charcteristics of componments found in fluids power circuits, such as valves
                    and regulators, as wellas the design of hydraulic and pnewmatic cricuits. The labs in this course involved designing and assembling different fluid power
                    circuits, inlcuding sequencing pneumatic actuated cylinders using pressure operated solenoid valves, as can be seen in the video.
                    <br>
                    The second half of the course covers how to control fluid power circuits using programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and how to construct state diagrams
                    and program the PLC using a ladder diagrams.

                        <!--TODO: Add a line maybe?-->
                        Numerical Control of Machine Tools covers all things related to CNC machining. The first half of the course covered writing and interpreting G-code and programing CNC
                        machines. The aluminum shield pictured was designed and programmed in MasterCam, and the tolerances of the machining were checked using a coordinate-measuring machine (CMM).
                        <br>
                        The second half of the course covered the forces involved in different machining operations. As part of the course I coded a force calculator for milling operations in python.

                    <p>
                        Electromechanical Machine Design is an introduction to mechanical design. The course covers integreated design of motion transmission systems, inlcuidng the following
                        components: gears, couplers, bearings, powerscrews, fastener, motors, actuators. The final project of the course was to design the shaft for a washing machine. This
                        project included doing force analysis to minimize the radius of the shaft, as well as sourcing appropriate seals and bearings for the requirements of the system.
                        Additionally drawings and assembly instructions of the design had to be made to ensure that the system was physically able to be manufacted.

                            Every year the studens Mechatronics Engineering students in their 3rd year are given a task they must design and build a robot to accomplish. In my year the task
                            was to create a line following robot which could then pick up and move a lego man to a designated safe space. My role on the team was to do the mechanical subsystem.
                            This included speccing out the motors, doing the CAD for the chassis and 3D printing it, as well as managing the integration of the electrical system. This process was
                            iterated to find a final design as one of the criteria for the robot was to make it as light and fast as possible.
